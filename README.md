  ## Description
This is my porfolio that I built using React. It is built 100% with conditional rendering, and no routes. The contact form submits, and the resume is downloadable. I used the tailwind css library for my styling.  It is fully responsive.
  ## Usage


  ## Installation
  - First clone the respository.
  - Install the dependancies with `npm install`
  - Run `npm run dev` to start the application.
  - Optionally  you can seed the database by stopping the server and running `node seeder -i` 
  - Run the server again with `npm run dev`
  - You can now use the routes in Insomnia. You can use the .json templates found in in the `_data` folder.
